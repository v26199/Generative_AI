### **Generative AI Playground**

**Welcome to my generative AI sandbox!** This repository showcases a collection of projects I've built to explore the exciting possibilities of AI-generated content. From crafting engaging blog posts to providing personalized assistance, these projects demonstrate my passion for pushing the boundaries of what's possible with generative models.

### **Key Projects**

* **Blogsmith:** A tool that leverages LLMs to generate high-quality blog posts on a variety of topics. 
* **Gemma-7B RAG:** A question-answering system built on the Gemma-7B model, using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for improved accuracy and relevance.
* **HotelAssist:** A chatbot designed to provide personalized assistance to hotel guests.
* **ImmigrationBot:** A chatbot that answers immigration-related questions, powered by Llama2 and Pinecone.
* **MediMate:** A medical chatbot that uses RAG to provide information and answer queries.
* **imgtospeech:** A model that converts images into speech, making content more accessible.
* **Prompt Engineering Experiments:** A series of experiments exploring different prompt engineering techniques to optimize model performance.
